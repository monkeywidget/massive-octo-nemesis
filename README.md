massive-octo-nemesis
====================

Interface, REST and Rules Engine for a Turing-complete "Lights Out"

The What Now?
-------------

"Lights Out" was a puzzle released by Tiger Electronics / Tiger Toys in 1995.

This is like that ... except much, much crazier.  

Also it runs on the Monome 40h interface, or more appropriately the Arduinome RGB (8x8).


Why is it named such a ridiculous thing?
----------------------------------------
  
Well, believe it or not, "massive-octo-nemesis" was the randomly-generated string 
suggested by GitHub.

Since one of my favorite movies is "I WORK FOR NEMESIS," I decided to keep it.
